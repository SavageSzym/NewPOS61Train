# NewPOS61Train
 This is effectively a McDonald's POS (Point of Sale) simulator. It is similar to the one used to train new McDonald's employees.
 This version of the training software was made for the United States of America and as a result of which will have localized American values such as the currency being in dollars. 
# POSData Files
If you're looking for the standalone POSData files and do not wish to download the NewPOS Software (the files that make up the POS items) they can be found [here](https://github.com/SavageSzymGroup/NP6-posdata).
# How-to Guides
I do not offer any guides for setup of the NewPOS Software for obvious reasons - that's something you are going to have to figure out yourself.
